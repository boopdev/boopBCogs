This repository contains cogs for the bCogs project, a project that will basically mirror the community cogs system of the Red Discord Bot. 

The only cog available in this is the booper cog, it just adds a simple boop command to your bot. you'll need the bCogs.py file in order to run the files, these aren't available to download yet.
